# TermMon_FTVSE

This repo includes a FactoryTalk View SE graphic that demonstrates the capabilities of the ThinManager TermMon ActiveX Control.  It was created with FactoryTalk View SE v14 and ThinManager v13.2, and relies on the tags included in the uploaded CSV file.  There is also a ThinManager configuration backup that includes the Display Clients utilized in the termmon.gfx file.

Once the graphic is imported and loaded within FTVSE, click the Enable button to establish a monitor connection, followed by clicking the Preset Tag Values for Lab button in the lower left corner of the graphic (which will pre-populate tag values).
